This example is based on the book `Machine Learning For Absolute Beginners: A Plain English Introduction (Second Edition)`

Tweaked the example, instead of predicting the housing price, here, I am trying to modify the model with another data set that describe the quality of beers, the features selected to do so are **style, rating, and brewery**

The book is actually very good for any beginner, ilustrates the steps of how to treat the data and select from a range of algorithms to train your model, which gives you the ability to model your first implementations of AI, highly recommended.
